# Windows-first iOS development workflow

This guide sets up a Vita3K fork so Windows is the primary editing and testing environment while GitHub Actions supplies the Apple SDK/Xcode build step. The resulting artifact is unsigned. Installation, signing, sideloading, and runtime JIT activation are intentionally outside this repository and guide.

## 1. What this branch can and cannot do

Today the workflow builds a real `arm64` iPhone/iPad IPA containing the iOS application host, a Metal view, lifecycle handling, persistent logs, sandbox storage, the first dependency-free upstream core slice, Vita3K's real package/SFO metadata parser, a 4 GiB guest address space, shared-page-aware segment mapping, preferred-address Vita VELF loading, checked relocation application, NID parsing, ARM import-stub rewriting, a bounded compiled-style module/thread diagnostic with common Thumb arithmetic, memory, stack, flag, and branch families, one core-owned Metal clear/present, normalized UIKit touch capture, and GameController polling. It does not yet contain a working Vita emulator because protected SELF extraction, complete Vita VFS mounting, general ARM/Thumb-2 execution, broader HLE, Vita graphics, guest input/audio services, and the wider dependency graph have not been ported to iOS. `VITA3K_IOS_LINK_CORE=ON` is required. The first guest-menu critical path is maintained in `ios/MENU-BOOT-CHECKLIST.md`.

Use the pipeline as a stable first milestone: every future porting change should keep the bootstrap IPA green while moving one subsystem across the `CoreBridge` boundary.

## 2. One-time accounts and Windows tools

You need:

- a GitHub account;
- Git for Windows;
- Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools or Visual Studio 2022 with Desktop development with C++;
- CMake and Ninja on `PATH`;
- VS Code with the C/C++ and CMake Tools extensions, or another C++ editor;
- enough disk space for Vita3K and its submodules.

Verify the command-line tools in PowerShell:

```powershell
git --version
cmake --version
ninja --version
```

## 3. Create and clone the fork

1. Open `https://github.com/Vita3K/Vita3K` and choose **Fork**.
2. Keep the complete history and create the fork under your GitHub account.
3. In PowerShell, replace `YOUR_GITHUB_NAME` below:

```powershell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/Vita3K.git
Set-Location Vita3K
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Vita3K/Vita3K.git
git switch -c ios-port
```

If this prepared repository was copied rather than cloned from your own fork, repoint `origin` first:

```powershell
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/Vita3K.git
git remote -v
```

Commit the iOS files and push the branch:

```powershell
git add CMakeLists.txt README.md .ci/package-ios.sh .github/workflows/ios.yml ios docs/ios-development.md
git commit -m "Add experimental unsigned iOS bootstrap pipeline"
git push -u origin ios-port
```

## 4. Run the unsigned IPA build

The workflow runs automatically for relevant pushes to `ios-port`. It can also be started manually:

1. Open the fork on GitHub.
2. Open **Actions**.
3. Select **Build unsigned iOS IPA**.
4. Choose **Run workflow**, select `ios-port`, and run it.
5. Wait for **Unsigned arm64 device IPA** to finish.
6. Open the completed run and download the `Vita3K-iOS-<commit>-unsigned` artifact.
7. Extract the Actions artifact ZIP once; it contains `Vita3K-iOS-unsigned.ipa`.

With GitHub CLI installed, the equivalent Windows commands are:

```powershell
gh workflow run ios.yml --ref ios-port
gh run list --workflow ios.yml --limit 5
gh run watch
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force artifacts | Out-Null
gh run download --name "Vita3K-iOS-COMMIT_SHA-unsigned" --dir artifacts
```

Replace `COMMIT_SHA` with the full SHA shown by the run. GitHub Actions artifacts are transport ZIPs, so do not rename that outer ZIP to `.ipa`; extract it to obtain the already packaged IPA.

## 5. What CI verifies

The macOS job:

1. configures the repository with the Xcode generator and the `iphoneos` SDK;
2. targets only `arm64` physical devices, not the simulator;
3. disables Xcode code signing;
4. builds `Vita3KiOS`;
5. checks the property list and confirms the executable contains `arm64`;
6. rejects the bundle if `codesign` reports a signature;
7. creates the required `Payload/Vita3K-iOS.app` IPA layout;
8. tests the resulting ZIP and uploads it as an Actions artifact.

No Apple certificates, passwords, provisioning profiles, or GitHub secrets are required for this unsigned build.

## 6. Daily Windows development loop

Keep shared emulator changes testable in the existing Windows target. Build only the part you changed when possible; a complete Vita3K desktop build has a large dependency graph.

```powershell
git switch ios-port
git pull --rebase
git submodule update --init --recursive

cmake --preset windows-ninja
cmake --build --preset windows-ninja --config Debug
ctest --preset windows-ninja -C Debug --output-on-failure
```

Preset names can change upstream. Check the current list with `cmake --list-presets` and use the Windows preset present in `CMakePresets.json`. Do not assume that passing an iOS toolchain to Windows will work: Apple frameworks, the iPhone SDK, asset tools, and linker are available only in Xcode on macOS.

After local tests:

```powershell
git add -A
git commit -m "Describe one iOS porting milestone"
git push
```

Then inspect the GitHub Actions log and download the new IPA artifact.

## 7. Device-oriented diagnostics

The bootstrap logger writes each message to both Apple unified logging and `Documents/vita3k.log`. File sharing and opening documents in place are enabled in `Info.plist`, making the log suitable for retrieval from the app's Documents area after a test run.

Every subsystem integrated into `CoreBridge` should log:

- build commit and configuration;
- lifecycle transition;
- last guest module and guest program counter;
- memory allocation/protection failure and host error;
- shader translation and pipeline compilation errors;
- last render pass/command-buffer milestone;
- active guest thread and fatal exception breadcrumb.

Keep logging bounded before the emulator core is enabled: add rotation (for example, three 5 MiB files) before high-frequency CPU or renderer tracing. Never log game keys, account credentials, or copyrighted game content.

For the Milestone 10 loader diagnostic, download `milestone10-vitasdk-homebrew.velf` from the same Actions artifact as the IPA. Remove the older fixture from `Documents/Vita3K/imports`, copy the VELF through the Files app, then tap **Rescan Imports**. A successful diagnostic reports `MAPPED`, 10 verified relocation patches, one rebound function stub, six executed instructions across Thumb/Thumb-2 and ARM modes, one HLE call, and a return value of 1. The accompanying SELF is probe-only; VPK, firmware, and commercial-game files remain outside the executable path.

For the Milestone 11 renderer diagnostic, launch the IPA on a physical device and wait for `Renderer: passed (first core-owned Metal frame presented)`. The blue background is a Metal clear color supplied by `HostDisplay`; it is not Vita graphics output. The portable smoke test validates frame ownership and completion bookkeeping, while the device build validates the actual MetalKit command queue and drawable presentation.

For the Milestone 12 input diagnostic, tap or drag on an empty area of the blue background. The status must change from `Input: ready` to `Input: passed` and show a positive touch-sample count plus normalized `x`/`y` coordinates. If a compatible controller is connected, its current sticks, D-pad, face buttons, shoulders, and triggers are sampled through GameController as well. These are host-input diagnostics only; they are not yet wired to Vita `SceCtrl` or touch HLE calls.

For the Milestone 13 metadata diagnostic, copy `milestone13-synthetic-param.sfo` from the Actions artifact into `Documents/Vita3K/imports`, then tap **Rescan Imports**. The app must report `PARAM.SFO`, `title ID M13TEST01`, and `title Vita3K iOS upstream metadata probe`. To inspect a user-owned Amagami dump without attempting to run it, copy only its `sce_sys/param.sfo`; the expected title ID is `PCSG00291`. Keep the game itself local and do not commit or upload it. This milestone parses metadata only—VPK installation, SELF loading, and game execution remain disconnected.

For Milestone 16, open **Game Library** and select an installed title. **Prefer Installed Patch** is enabled by default in **Settings**, so a patch `eboot.bin` is prepared before the base app executable. The operation is deliberately non-executing: it validates the SELF and ELF headers, inventories load/compression/encryption state, and maps only structurally valid plain segments. Protected retail SELF files should report that decryption must be integrated. Preserve that exact diagnostic for the next milestone; do not upload the executable or game archive.

For Milestone 17, re-select a successfully prepared title and tap **Attempt Boot (256 Instructions)**. The confirmation is an intentional safety boundary. The call uses only the portable interpreter, cannot activate JIT, is capped at 256 instructions, and consumes the prepared state so it cannot be repeated without a clean reload. Capture the first unsupported opcode/PC, memory fault, unbound HLE NID, return, exit, or instruction-limit message. Share the diagnostic text only; never upload the selected game executable.

For Milestone 18, re-select the installed title and confirm the preparation detail says `via lifecycle export`. This proves that the loader used the `NID_MODULE_START` address from the export entry table instead of interpreting a module-info-relative location as the first instruction. Run the same one-shot bounded attempt and capture the corrected first CPU or HLE boundary. The CI artifact's `milestone18-lifecycle-export.zip` is the legal regression test; its synthetic `M15TEST01` must exit with status 42.

For Milestone 19, re-select `PCSG00291`, confirm `via lifecycle export`, and run the one-shot attempt again. The bounded interpreter now accepts the `0xE92D` wide `PUSH.W`/`STMDB sp!` prologue captured at `0x81017580`; any later unsupported Thumb-2 diagnostic includes both halfwords. The CI artifact's `milestone19-thumb2-wide-push.zip` is the legal regression test; its synthetic `M15TEST01` saves a high register through `PUSH.W {r8, lr}` and exits with status 42.

For Milestone 20, run the same Amagami attempt and capture the full boundary plus `Lookahead:` suffix. The interpreter now accepts the captured `0xB082` (`SUB sp, #8`) and a coherent baseline of common Thumb arithmetic, CPSR flags, memory, stack, high-register, multiple-transfer, compare-and-branch, and branch encodings. The CI artifact's `milestone20-thumb-compiler-baseline.zip` is the legal installable regression; its synthetic `M15TEST01` executes 13 instructions, two HLE calls, and exits with status 42.

For Milestone 21, run the one-shot Amagami attempt again and capture the next complete boundary. The interpreter now accepts the exact `F247 6290` / `E9CD 1000` / `F2C8 122C` sequence as part of complete Thumb-2 immediate `MOVW`/`MOVT` and immediate `LDRD`/`STRD` families, including checked pre/post-index writeback. The CI artifact's `milestone21-thumb2-compiler-batch.zip` executes those exact opcodes in a legal synthetic title, completes nine instructions and one HLE call, and exits with status 42.

For Milestone 22, repeat the one-shot attempt and return the entire unbound-HLE diagnostic. A canonical rebound import trampoline is now recognized from its `SVC; MOV pc,lr; inline NID` layout even when no handler exists, so the boundary reports the real NID instead of falling back to zero in `r12`. It also reports the upstream name, SVC and LR addresses, `r0`–`r3`, and module-import inventory status. The CI artifact's `milestone22-inline-hle-diagnostic.zip` verifies this path with an unimplemented `__sceAppMgrGetAppState` import and deliberately zero `r12`; no unknown HLE result is fabricated.

Keep firmware files such as `fontpkg.pup`, `preinstall.pup`, and the system update PUP on the local device/PC. Do not add them to Git, CI caches, or Actions artifacts. Firmware selection and extraction will be added after the iOS build includes the upstream crypto, package, FAT/exFAT, and psvpfs dependencies needed by `install_pup`.

## 8. Keeping the fork current

Sync in a dedicated commit so upstream changes are easy to separate from the iOS port:

```powershell
git fetch upstream
git switch ios-port
git merge --no-ff upstream/master
git submodule update --init --recursive
git push
```

Resolve conflicts by preserving the early iOS-only branch in the root `CMakeLists.txt`; without it, configuration falls into upstream's desktop Qt/MoltenVK graph.

## 9. How to assign useful Codex milestones

Ask for one verifiable subsystem at a time and require the Windows build plus the unsigned-IPA workflow to remain green. A useful task template is:

> On branch `ios-port`, read `ios/NEXT-MILESTONE-HANDOFF.md`, inspect the latest device diagnostic, and implement exactly one next bounded milestone. Preserve desktop and Android behavior. Add Windows-runnable regression coverage, keep `.github/workflows/ios.yml` producing an unsigned IPA plus legal synthetic test fixtures, run the portable tests, push `ios-port`, wait for the Action, and report the artifact name and SHA-256. Do not add signing, sideloading, JIT activation, proprietary firmware, keys, or game files. State exactly what remains stubbed and do not claim a commercial game is playable.

Good early assignments are dependency inventory, extracting a headless core target, sandbox path mapping, a renderer surface interface, or a deterministic CPU/memory unit-test harness. “Build the whole emulator” is too broad to diagnose when CI fails.

## Milestone 23 runtime boundary

Run the one-shot Amagami attempt after preparing the installed patch. NID `0xBFE02B3A` now invokes the upstream-compatible `__cxa_set_dso_handle_main` handler, stores `r0` in per-run libc state, returns zero through the import ABI, and continues within the same 256-instruction budget. Return the next complete boundary. The CI artifact's `milestone23-libc-dso-runtime.zip` proves one successful HLE dispatch, handle `0x81000200`, and a clean seven-instruction module return.

## Milestone 24 broad Thumb-2 runtime families

Milestone 24 intentionally batches full instruction families. The interpreter implements Thumb-2 modified-immediate logical/arithmetic/test operations with architectural immediate expansion and flags, plus wide signed/unsigned byte, halfword, and word immediate loads/stores with checked offset and writeback modes. This advances the accepted Amagami boundary past `F05F 0B00` and the following `F8DD A000` in one build. The CI artifact `milestone24-thumb2-runtime-families.zip` executes both after the stateful libc call and returns after nine instructions.

## Milestone 25 broad register-operated runtime families

Milestone 25 implements Thumb-2 shifted-register scalar ALU/test operations and the move/immediate-shift aliases, including `RRX`, together with scaled register-offset signed/unsigned single-memory operations. The accepted Milestone 24 boundary was `EBAA 0202` (`SUB.W r2, r10, r2`) after 28 instructions and one HLE call. The CI artifact `milestone25-thumb2-register-families.zip` executes that exact subtraction after the prior runtime sequence and returns after ten instructions. Device diagnostics now include sixteen look-ahead halfwords.

## Milestone 26 libc termination registration

The accepted Milestone 25 device run reached `__aeabi_atexit` after 72 instructions and one prior HLE call. Milestone 26 binds `__aeabi_atexit`, `__cxa_atexit`, and `__cxa_finalize`, preserves normalized registration/finalization arguments in the boot result, and returns the upstream-compatible zero result. It intentionally does not invoke guest destructor callbacks. The CI artifact `milestone26-libc-termination.zip` reproduces the registration path and returns after nine instructions; portable tests also cover the alternate `__cxa_atexit` argument order and finalize bookkeeping.

## Milestone 27 Thumb-2 multiple transfers

The accepted Milestone 26 device run reached `E8BD 81F0` (`POP.W {r4-r8, pc}`) after 106 instructions, four HLE calls, and three termination registrations. Milestone 27 implements the safe Thumb-2 increment-after and decrement-before load/store-multiple family with optional writeback, high registers, push/pop aliases, checked contiguous memory access, and PC interworking. The CI artifact `milestone27-thumb2-multiple-transfer.zip` pairs the exact captured pop with its matching wide push and returns after two instructions.

## Milestone 28 C++ static-initialization guards

The accepted Milestone 27 device run advanced to 122 instructions and reached `__cxa_guard_acquire` (NID `0xD0310E31`) for guest guard `0x812C75D8`. Milestone 28 implements the complete Arm 32-bit one-time-construction API: acquire ownership and exact 0/1 results, release with initialized-bit publication, abort without publication, aligned guest-memory validation, and a hard recursive-initialization boundary. CI emits `milestone28-cxa-guards.zip`; portable regressions exercise every handler and both acquire outcomes.

## Milestone 29 bounded libc guest heap

The accepted Milestone 28 device run advanced to 133 instructions and five HLE calls, then reached `memalign` (NID `0xA9363E6B`) with alignment 16 and size 384. Milestone 29 maps a bounded guest arena and implements `calloc`, `malloc`, `memalign`, `free`, `realloc`, and `malloc_usable_size` with block reuse, coalescing, alignment, zeroing, resize preservation, and diagnostics. CI emits `milestone29-libc-heap.zip`, whose synthetic title reproduces the captured allocation and returns aligned address `0x90000000`.

## Milestone 30 LR shifted-register execution runway

The accepted Milestone 29 device run advanced to 138 instructions and six HLE calls with one successful 384-byte aligned heap allocation. Its next instruction is `EB00 00CE`, decoded as `ADD.W r0, r0, lr, LSL #3`. Milestone 30 corrects the Thumb-2 shifted-register validation to treat LR as a legal general operand across the full logical/arithmetic/test family while SP and PC remain rejected except for their architecturally defined aliases. CI emits `milestone30-thumb2-lr-shifted-register.zip`, which executes the exact opcode and returns 44. The physical-device one-shot budget is now 4096 interpreted instructions, still without JIT and still stopping at the first unsupported instruction, guest-memory fault, or unknown HLE call.

## Milestone 31 instrumented execution runway

The accepted Milestone 30 device run crossed the former CPU boundary and then consumed the entire 4096-instruction budget with 14 successful HLE calls and zero heap failures. Milestone 31 raises the hard one-shot ceiling to 65536 while retaining interpreter-only, stop-on-first-unknown behavior. At exhaustion it reports unique and hottest PC counts, non-forward transfers, an eight-PC history, all general registers/CPSR, and Thumb lookahead. A deterministic self-branch regression proves hot-loop candidate classification, while a sequential NOP regression proves normal forward execution is not mislabeled. CI emits `milestone31-execution-progress.zip` for the same bounded loop diagnostic.

## Milestone 32 C++ allocation ABI

The accepted Milestone 31 device run continued forward to 5637 instructions and 30 HLE calls, then stopped at `_Znwj` (NID `0xF99ED5AC`) with an 8-byte request. Milestone 32 implements all ten adjacent 32-bit C++ allocation/deallocation exports in the Vita NID database. They reuse the bounded guest heap, preserve regular, array, nothrow, null-delete, and placement-delete semantics, and expose per-run call diagnostics. Throwing allocation exhaustion stops because exception unwinding is not yet present; nothrow exhaustion returns null. CI emits `milestone32-cxx-allocation.zip`, and portable tests execute every handler plus both exhaustion paths.

## Milestone 33 AppUtil lifecycle

The accepted Milestone 32 device run completed `_Znwj(8)`, then advanced to 5676 instructions and 31 HLE calls before reaching `sceAppUtilInit` with two mapped guest parameter blocks. Milestone 33 implements stateful init/shutdown using the official VitaSDK `0x40`/`0x28` structure sizes, bounded guest reads, reserved-field checks, documented parameter/state errors, and observable input diagnostics. Unmapped pointers stop rather than becoming host pointers. Savedata, events, mounts, and system settings are deliberately not faked. CI emits `milestone33-app-util-lifecycle.zip`, and portable tests cover valid init, null input, an unmapped pointer, shutdown-before-init, and a complete paired lifecycle.

## Milestone 34 public Sysmodule lifecycle

The accepted Milestone 33 device run advanced through AppUtil to `sceSysmoduleLoadModule(0x15)` (`SCE_SYSMODULE_NP`) at 5683 instructions and 32 HLE calls. Milestone 34 binds `sceSysmoduleLoadModule`, `sceSysmoduleIsLoaded`, and `sceSysmoduleUnloadModule` as a stateful family matching upstream HLE bookkeeping and error values. Loading makes a module available to HLE dispatch but does not claim firmware execution. CI emits `milestone34-sysmodule-lifecycle.zip`; portable tests cover load/status/unload/status ordering, unloaded queries, and invalid IDs.

## Milestone 35 NP and Trophy startup lifecycle

The accepted Milestone 34 device run loaded NP plus NP Trophy and reached `sceNpInit(nullptr, nullptr)` at 5692 instructions and 34 HLE calls. Milestone 35 batches NP init/service-state/term with Trophy init/term. It validates optional communication guest pointers, reports deterministic offline signed-out state through checked guest writes, preserves upstream lifecycle errors, and cascades NP termination into Trophy shutdown. Callback and trophy-context APIs remain diagnostic boundaries pending scheduler and VFS support. CI emits `milestone35-np-lifecycle.zip`, and portable tests cover all state transitions and pointer boundaries.

## Milestone 36 NP Trophy object lifecycle

The accepted Milestone 35 run advanced to `sceNpTrophyCreateContext` at 5712 instructions and 36 HLE calls after both NP lifecycles initialized. Milestone 36 binds create/destroy context and create/destroy/abort handle as one stateful family. It uses bounded Communication ID reads, checked context/handle output writes, guest-visible IDs, upstream state/error values, and termination cleanup. It intentionally does not return invented TRP-derived trophy data. CI emits `milestone36-trophy-objects.zip`; nine portable paths cover the captured success case, invalid state/arguments/IDs, unmapped memory, and handle operations.

## Milestone 37 controller startup HLE

The accepted Milestone 36 device run crossed Trophy context creation and stopped at `sceCtrlSetSamplingMode(2)` after 5722 instructions and 37 HLE calls. Milestone 37 adds the 19-function upstream controller startup/read cluster in one batch. Standard/extended sampling state, handheld port discovery, wireless information, multi-controller support, and every positive/negative read/peek buffer import now use bounded state and guest writes. Neutral samples keep both sticks centered until `HostInput` is connected to guest HLE; read blocking remains a scheduler/display-vblank task rather than a fabricated wait. CI emits `milestone37-controller-hle.zip`, and deterministic tests cover set/get state, two-sample output, invalid modes, and invalid buffers.

## Milestone 38 touch, time, power, and display startup HLE

The accepted Milestone 37 device run accepted controller sampling mode 2 and stopped at `sceTouchSetSamplingState(0, 1)` after 5,735 instructions and 38 HLE calls. Milestone 38 clears the reached touch boundary and proactively batches the adjacent high-confidence startup families with upstream Vita3K semantics: touch sampling/panel/density/force/peek/read with neutral empty samples and checked guest writes, process/system/RTC time on one deterministic virtual microsecond clock, power clock and offline battery reporting, and display vblank/vcount/refresh plus validated framebuffer set/get records. Eighteen new deterministic Windows-runnable fixtures cover success, invalid-argument, null-pointer, and unmapped-memory paths, including guest-visible readback of panel geometry and clock reports through `sceKernelExitThread`. CI emits `milestone38-startup-services.zip`.

## 10. Troubleshooting CI

- **CMake enters the desktop Qt build:** confirm `-DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS` and `-DVITA3K_BUILD_IOS=ON` are both present.
- **No `.app` found:** inspect the build step for the actual Xcode configuration and SDK; the packaging script accepts only a `*-iphoneos` device bundle.
- **Bundle is signed:** remove inherited signing settings. The packager intentionally refuses signed input.
- **Workflow does not run after a push:** it watches the `ios-port` branch and iOS/build files. Start it manually for other branches or adjust the branch filter in your fork.
- **Core self-tests fail:** capture `Documents/vita3k.log`; the current tests cover Vita3K's ARM instruction encoder and NID database.
